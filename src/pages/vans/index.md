Vans is a popular skateboard shoe manufacturer and apparel company based in Santa Ana, CA. In February 2016, we launched a new about page for the company's 20th anniversary campaign. I was responsible for the front-end development of the page. The project features a large scrollable timeline showcasing the history of Vans since its birth in 1966. We displayed the information in cards to make it easier to digest the company's long history.
