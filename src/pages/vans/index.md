Vans is a popular skateboard shoe manufacturer and apparel company based in Santa Ana, CA. I was responsible for the front-end development of a new about page for the company's 50th anniversary marketing campaign. The project features a large scrollable timeline showcasing the history of Vans since 1966. Our team displayed the information in cards to make it easier to digest the company's long history.
