Cuker Agency is a digital agency that provides robust e-commerce websites and digital marketing consulting. I was responsible for the front-end development of Cuker Agency's <a href="https://www.cukeragency.com/" target="_blank">new website</a>. I conceptialized a design system for easily creating unique, but consistent looking case studies. I also adapted the existing content to the new design.
