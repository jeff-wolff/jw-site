Rip Curl is &lsquo;the ultimate surfing company&rsquo; specializing in wetsuits, watches, and apparel. In November 2015, we launched a responsive website to enable surfers to shop on their mobile phones. I was responsible for the front-end development of the page. We took their existing design and updated it to be mobile friendly.
