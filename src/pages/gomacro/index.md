- GoMacro is a protein bar company that encourages a healthy plant-based lifestyle. 

- Our team provided a better website user experience, e-commerce platform, and a comprehensive marketing campaign.

- I was responsible for the front-end development of the new website.

- In January 2019, I reimagined and simplified the website design system, updated the homepage design, and added a new type to the website which helps create a more 'natural' look.
