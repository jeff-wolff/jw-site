GoMacro is a protein bar company that encourages a healthy plant-based lifestyle. I was responsible for the front-end development of the website. I developed a theme system which allows each product page to have its own style based on the custom style of the packaging. The <a href="https://www.gomacro.com/how-its-made/" target="_blank">&lsquo;How It&lsquo;s Made&rsquo;</a> page features an animation triggered by scrolling.
