title: "New Site Launched"
---

Welcome to version 4 of my portfolio website! The design is inspired by a modern Windows 98 / DOS-like interface. 

The website is built with GatsbyJS, a free and open-source framework based on React that helps developers build extremely performant static sites. 

I am utilizing Markdown to write my posts, which acts as a data source for the static site. To render the data on the page I am querying the content through GraphQL.

## Work Section
The latest websites I have made are showcased in the <a href="/work/">work section</a> in draggable, collapsable, and resizable windows. 

Each client project has a custom theme with unique colors managed with CSS variables and JavaScript. The bottom of the project has a “video demo” section which showcases the responsive design of the websites in draggable windows.

## Notes Section
The <a href="/notes/">notes section</a> is a new place on my site where I can jot down my ideas and tutorials on whatever topic interests me.

Hope you enjoy and please contact me if something looks awry!
