title: "New Site Launched"
---

Welcome to version 4 of my portfolio website! The design is inspired by a modern Windows 98 / DOS-like interface. 

The website is built with <a href="https://gatsbyjs.org" target="_blank" rel="nooppener nofollow">GatsbyJS</a>, a free and open-source framework based on <a href="https://reactjs.org" target="_blank" rel="nooppener nofollow">React</a> that helps developers build extremely performant static sites.

I am utilizing <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax" target="_blank" rel="nooppener nofollow">Markdown</a> to write my posts, which acts as a data source for the static site. To render the data on the page I am querying the content through GraphQL.



## Work
The latest websites I have made are showcased in the [work section](/work/) in draggable, collapsable, and resizable windows. 

Each client project has a custom theme with unique colors managed with CSS variables and JavaScript. The bottom of the project has a “video demo” section which showcases the responsive design of the websites in draggable/resizable windows.



## Notes
The [notes section](/notes/)</a> is a new place on my site where I can jot down my ideas or muse over whatever topic interests me. Each post can also be styled with a [custom theme](/time-machine/)</a>.


## Contact
Hope you enjoy and please [contact me](mailto:hi@jeffwolff.net)</a> if something looks awry!
