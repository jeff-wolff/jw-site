title: "New Site Launched 2"

Welcome to Version 4 of my portfolio website! The design inspiration was a modern Windows 98 / DOS-like interface. 

The website is built with GatsbyJS, a free and open source framework based on React that helps developers build extremely performant static sites. I am utilizing Markdown to write my posts, which acts as a data source for the static site. To render the data on the page I am querying the content through GraphQL.

The latest websites I have made are showcased in the Work section in draggable, collapsable, and resizable windows. Each portfolio detail page has a custom theme with unique colors by utilizing CSS Variables and JavaScript. The bottom of the work page has a “video demo” section which showcases the responsiveness of the websites in draggable windows. 

The Notes section was born so I can jot down my ideas on whatever topic interests me. And it will help me get better at writing.

Hope you enjoy and please contact me if something looks awry!
